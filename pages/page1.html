            Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for
            HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the
            first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta,
            Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019,
            with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.

            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows
            several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven
            Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the
            throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the
            realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne.
            The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond
            Westeros's northern border.

               <p class="info2">
                  Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R.
                  Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The series follows
                  several simultaneous plot lines. The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for
                  control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the
                  throne. The second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of
                  the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North. Showrunner David
                  Benioff jokingly suggested "The Sopranos in Middle-earth" as Game of Thrones's tagline, referring to its
                  intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons.
