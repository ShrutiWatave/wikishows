            Arcane is a 2021 animated streaming television series. 
            It is set in the League of Legends universe. 
            The series was announced at the League of Legends tenth anniversary celebration.
            It was produced by Riot Games and Fortiche, a French animation studio based in Paris.
            Set in the past relative to the League of Legends universe, Arcane serves as a prequel to the game and retells the origin stories of several characters from Piltover and Zaun. 
            Like the game which it is based on, Arcane is aimed at a "16+" audience.

            The series has received widespread universal acclaim from critics, who praised the blend of hand-drawn and CGI animation as well as the story, world-building, characters and voice acting.
            It also set the record as Netflix's best-rated show so far within a week of its premiere and ranked number one on the Netflix Top 10 chart in 52 countries as well as reaching number two in the United States.
            On November 20, 2021, following the conclusion of Arcane's first season, Riot Games and Netflix announced that a second season was in production for a post-2022 release

               <p class="info2">
                  Set in utopian Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, the story follows the origins of two iconic League champions-and the power that will tear them apart.

                  The delicate balance between the rich city of Piltover and the seedy underbelly of Zaun. 
                  Tensions between these city-states boil over with the creation of hextech a way for any person to control magical energy in Piltover, and in Zaun, a new drug called shimmer transforms humans into monsters. 
                  The rivalry between the cities splits families and friends as Arcane brings life to the relationships that shape some of League of Legends' famous champions including Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Jayce and Viktor.

                  In the cities of Piltover and Zaun, tensions rise as inventors, hooligans, politicians and crime lords grow increasingly fed up with the constraints of a devastated society. 
                  With the situation on the verge of being unsustainable, two sisters steal an artifact of immeasurable power. 
                  Discovery and danger collide as heroes are born and bonds are broken. 
                  Will this power change the world? Or will it lead to ruin? This is the world of Arcane.
