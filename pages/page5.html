         How I Met Your Mother (often abbreviated as HIMYM) is an American sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and Carter
         Bays for CBS. The series, which ran from 2005 to 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of
         friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in the year 2030, recounts to his son, Luke,
         and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. How I Met
         Your Mother is a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Television and syndicated by 20th
         Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television). <br>
         The series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in Chicago The vast
         majority of episodes were directed by Pamela Fryman, who directed 196 episodes out of 208. The other directors
         were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).

               The series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man.
               His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby twenty-five years later as he tells them to his
               adolescent children.

               The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with the 27-year-old Ted Mosby living in New York City
               and working as an architect. <br> The narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the long-lasting
               couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), womanizing playboy Barney Stinson
               (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders); all of the characters'
               lives are entwined.
