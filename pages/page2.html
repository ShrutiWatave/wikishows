      <p class="info">
         The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom served
         as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. All three also served as head writers. It
         premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007, and concluded on May 16, 2019, having broadcast 279 episodes over 12
         seasons. <br>
         The show was filmed in front of a live audience, and produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre
         Productions. It received mixed reviews throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the
         second and third seasons. Despite early mixed reviews, seven seasons were ranked within the top ten of the
         final season ratings, and it ultimately reached the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season.
         <br>
         The show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second pilot produced for the show. A
         different pilot was produced for the 2006â€“07 television season but never aired. The structure of the original
         unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form.

            <h3 class="titleinfo2">PLOT</h3>
            <p class="info2">
               Set in Pasadena, California the show is about two fictional Caltech geniuses, one an experimental
               physicist, Leonard Hofstadter, and the other a theoretical physicist, Sheldon Cooper, who live across the
               hall from an attractive blonde waitress and aspiring actress, Penny (whose last name remains unknown).
               Leonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills
               and common sense. An aerospace engineer, Howard Wolowitz, and a particle astrophysicist, Rajesh
               Koothrappali, are their equally geeky and socially awkward co-workers and friends. They are the kind of
               "beautiful minds" that understand how the universe works, but none of that helps them interact with
               people, especially women. As the show develops, each male finds his female counterpart, though Raj is
               single at the end of the series.
