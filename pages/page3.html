      <p class="info">
         Brooklyn Nine-Nine is an American police procedural comedy television series that aired on Fox, later airing on
         NBC from September 17, 2013, to September 16, 2021, after eight seasons and 153 episodes. It was created by Dan
         Goor. <br> <br>
         Produced as a single-camera comedy, Fox originally ordered 13 episodes for its first season, eventually
         expanding it to 22 episodes. Brooklyn Nine-Nine premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox cancelled
         the series after five seasons. The following day, NBC picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on
         NBC on January 10, 2019. The seventh season premiered in February 2020. The 10-episode eighth and final season
         premiered on August 12, 2021. <br><br>
         Writers and producers Michael Schur and Dan Goor, who had known each other since they were students at Harvard
         University, and had collaborated on the sitcom Parks and Recreation, conceived the idea to set a comedy in a
         police station, a setting they felt had been insufficiently used in television comedies since Barney Miller.

            <h3 class="titleinfo2">PLOT</h3>
            <p class="info2">
               Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine
               follows a team of detectives headed by the serious and intellectual Captain Raymond Holt, who is assigned
               as their new commanding officer in the pilot episode. <br><br>
               The detectives include Jake Peralta, an investigator with a high rate of solved cases despite his relaxed and often childish attitude, who
               eventually falls for his nerdy, by-the-book, but skilled partner, Amy Santiago. Jake's best friend, the
               timid and loyal Charles Boyle, is often partnered with the intense and aggressive Rosa Diaz. The two
               older detectives, Michael Hitchcock and Norm Scully, often seem incompetent and lazy, but were once
               legendary detectives.
