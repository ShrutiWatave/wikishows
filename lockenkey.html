                    Locke & Key tells the story of the Locke siblings, Tyler, Kinsey, and little Bode, who, along with their mother, return to their ancestral home of Keyhouse following their father’s gruesome murder. Keyhouse is a place of both wonder and fear, filled with dark doors and the magic keys that open them, and also home to a malicious presence that will stop at nothing in it’s quest for the Omega Key and the unspeakable prize it unlocks.

                    After Rendell Locke is murdered at the hands of former student Sam Lesser, his wife Nina decides to move with her three children, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode, from Seattle to Matheson, Massachusetts, and take residence in Rendell's family home, Keyhouse. The children soon discover a number of mysterious keys throughout the house that can be used to unlock various doors in magical ways. They soon become aware, though, of a demonic entity that is also searching for the keys for its own malevolent purposes.

                    Twenty-five years ago, the Keepers of the Keys - consisting of Rendell Locke, Kim Topher, Jeff Ellis, Mark Cho, Erin Voss, and Ellie Whedon, and her boyfriend Lucas Caravaggio - used one of several magical keys, the Omega Key, to open the Black Door, leading to the possession of Caravaggio by a mindless shadow demon. Tragically, Locke is forced to kill Caravaggio and the keepers somberly disband. Locke's brother, Duncan, saw what happened, so they had no choice but to remove his memories and use the Plant Key to hide them. In the modern day, Ellie uses one of the keys to summon a mysterious entity named "Echo" - whom she nicknames "Dodge" - into the Wellhouse, assuming she was bringing Lucas back from the dead and unintentionally trapping Echo there, leaving the infuriated and emaciated girl consumed with revenge. Nine months later, a man phones Ellie from in an eerie town, fearing for the exposure of his memories to forces of darkness. Removing a key from his safe, he jabs it into his chin, causing himself and his entire house to explode into flames. Three months after that, Rendell is visited by underage criminal Sam Lesser, who sadistically murders him when he refuses to disclose information regarding Keyhouse, resulting in the Locke family - consisting of the outgoing Tyler, the introverted Kinsey, little Bode and their kindly mother Nina - relocating to their family home. They are welcomed there by their uncle Duncan. The following day, Tyler and Kinsey begin school while Duncan leaves to head back to Boston for work, and hands Keyhouses' keys over to Nina. As a new member of the school hockey team, Tyler attends a party and meets Javi and Eden Hawkins, two extremely popular yet narcissistic Matheson students, and flirts with Eden's close friend Jackie Veda. Kinsey meets up with Scot Cavendish and his informal friend group calling themselves the Savini Squad, and they watch a movie, but she leaves upon the flawed realization that she is not a heroine at all, much to Scot's chagrin.
